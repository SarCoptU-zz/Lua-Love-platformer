1. TITLE

2. SUMMARY

Dungeon platformer in a medieval setting. Dark atmosphere, similar to Salt and Sanctuary.

3. STORY BRIEF

You are a prisoner for a crime that you don’t remember in a place you don’t recognize.

4. GAMEPLAY

Goal: to escape the dungeon unscathed.

Position:
Very important as the sword arc needs to touch the enemy
Need to think of hit boxes here
Touching the enemy causes damage - less than enemy attacks
Power up before boss to give the player sword arcs - range

Items on in each hand
Torch - the player can just pick it up to create a halo of light around the character
Sword
Maybe shield

Enemies: humans or creatures???
1 - stationary enemy with sword
2 - archer on higher up platforms
3 - tougher enemy with sword, moving
BOSS

Controls
left/right for directions
Space for jump
F for attack
G for pick up
? for block if we have it
